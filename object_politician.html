			          <p class=body>The politician must maintain its popularity to make sure it gets elected in the four-yearly general elections. 

The higher the popularity, the higher the chance of winning the election. Popularity depends on maintaining a good balance between a secure water supply (where supply is 50% greater than demand) and

an efficient supply (where supply is just over demand). Popularity is lost when supply is too high or if supply

is too low in relation to demand. It is also lost if water quality decreases or if prices rise without a successful referendum of 

the people (the outcome of which is dependent on your popularity). Popularity increases if supply and demand are matched or water quality is high. Popularity can also be increased by 

campaigning, but this costs money. Alternatively money can be used to subsidise other players to do things that you want them to do. For example, if you want

demand to fall, then you might subsidise the manufacturers to produce water saving water systems, which are normally more expensive to produce than normal ones.

						<ul>

						<li class=body>maintain high popularity in order to win elections (poor system indicators = poor popularity).

						<BR><i>Hint</i>: system indicators such as demand, supply and water quality affect your popularity. High levels of environmental awareness lowers demand, as does the use of water saving technology by the housing associations.  Water quality is worsened by over-supply of water. Supply can be increased by building reservoirs and reduced by closing them.

						<li class=body>subsidise other players to take action that will lead to high popularity for yourself

						<BR><i>Hint</i>: if you want to increase demand, encourage housing associations to buy normal water systems.

						<li class=body>agree to a price rise or fall when requested by the water utility, 

						or call a referendum if a price rise is wanted

						<BR><i>Hint</i>: if prices rise your popularity will fall unless you call a referendum and win it.
