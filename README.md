# Zurich Water Game
## zwg

Requirements:
* Apache web server
* PHP
* MySQL
If you don't already have that, try googling MAMP for a self-contained, already set up suite with these packages.

## Running ZWG
To start this, first clone the files from Github into your web root.  Then access http://example.com/createdb.php from your web browser.  This will create a MySQL data base for the game.
